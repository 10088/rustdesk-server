### RustDesk | Your Remote Desktop Software

**DOWNLOAD**](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk-server/releases)

This is a repository used to release RustDesk server software and track issues.

Built on Centos7 and Windows10, tested on Centos7/8, Ubuntu 18/20.

There are two executables
  - hbbs - RustDesk ID/Rendezvous server
  - hbbr - RustDesk relay server

By default, hbbs listens on 21115(tcp) and 21116(tcp/udp), hbbr listens on 21117(tcp)

[check here](https://rustdesk.com/blog/id-relay-set/) for more information about setting up your cloud with hbbs/hbbr.

If you need a Windows client installation program that does not need to manually fill in the custom server address, please contact us by email. We already have a complete solution.
